# CS50 Projects

Welcome to my CS50 Projects repository! This repository contains a collection of projects I completed during my study of Harvard University's CS50 course. Each project folder in this repository contains specific project details, including code, documentation, and usage instructions.

## Experience Gained

Throughout the CS50 course, I gained valuable experience in various areas of computer science and software development:

- **Programming Fundamentals**: The course provided a solid foundation in programming, covering languages such as C and Python. I learned about data types, loops, conditionals, and basic problem-solving techniques.

- **Web Development**: I acquired web development skills, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Flask. I learned how to create interactive and responsive web applications. The projects I completed include web-based games, stock trading simulations, and data aggregation websites.

- **Software Engineering**: CS50 emphasized software engineering principles, best practices, and debugging techniques. I learned how to structure code, write clean and maintainable code, and work effectively on larger software projects.

- **Problem Solving**: The course included numerous problem-solving exercises and coding challenges. These exercises helped me develop my logical and analytical thinking and improve my problem-solving abilities.

- **Version Control**: I became proficient in using Git and GitHub for version control. This skill is essential for collaborative software development and tracking changes in code.

- **Full-Stack Development**: I gained experience in building full-stack web applications, covering both the front-end and back-end development. This involved working with databases, creating RESTful APIs, and handling user authentication.

- **Data Structures and Algorithms**: The course provided an in-depth understanding of data structures and algorithms, which are crucial for efficient programming and problem-solving.

- **Community and Collaboration**: I had the opportunity to collaborate with fellow learners, participate in online discussion forums, and seek help from a supportive community of students and teaching staff.
