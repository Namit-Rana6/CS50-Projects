Mario-less: In CS50, "Mario-less" usually refers to the "Mario" problem set. The goal of this problem set is to create a pyramid-like structure, similar to the classic game Super Mario, but without any actual characters. Students are required to implement a program in C that prints out a pyramid of a specified height, using hash characters (#) as blocks.

Population: "Population" is another problem set in CS50 that determine how long it takes for a population to reach a particular size in terms of lamas.

Cash: The "Cash" problem set in CS50 involves working with algorithms and loops. Students are required to create a program in C that calculates the minimum number of coins required to make change for a given amount of money. This problem set focuses on implementing a greedy algorithm to find the optimal solution.
